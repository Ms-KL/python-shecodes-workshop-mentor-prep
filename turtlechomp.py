import turtle

# ! STEP 4.5: import math module
import math

# ! STEP 4.7: import random module
import random

# ! STEP 1.5: setup screen
turtle.setup(650,650) # window size
wn = turtle.Screen() # alias for screen
wn.bgcolor('navy') #background colour

# ! STEP 7.6: stop screen from being jumpy due to refreshing of multiple foods.
# tells computer not to refresh screen each time and speeds up animation
wn.tracer(3)


# ! STEP 3.2: draw border
mypen = turtle.Turtle()
mypen.penup()
mypen.setposition(-300,-300) # bottom left corner
mypen.pendown()

# ! STEP 3.5: change border thickness and color
mypen.pensize(6)
mypen.color('yellow')
mypen.speed(0) # fastest speed (instant draw of border - remove to see border being drawn)
for side in range(4): # draw square (repeat loop/side 4 times)
    mypen.forward(600) # length of square
    mypen.left(90) # angle of square
mypen.hideturtle() # hide turtle

# ! STEP 1.6: create player turtle
player = turtle.Turtle()
player.color('darkorange')
player.shape('turtle')
player.penup() # won't leave a line as the turtle moves

# ! STEP 2.7: fix turtle from jumping when arrow keys are pressed
player.speed(0) # 0 = fasted animation speed

# ! STEP 7.1: create empty list to count for max number of cabbages
maxFoods = 20
foods = [] 

# ! STEP 7.2: for loop to count and move food until maxFoods number is reached
# this ends up foods.[1] = object, foods.[2] = object etc until max foods is reached
for count in range(maxFoods):
    new_food = turtle.Turtle()
    new_food.color("lightgreen")
    new_food.shape("circle")

    new_food.speed(0)
    new_food.setposition(random.randint(-290, 290), random.randint(-290, 290))
    foods.append(new_food)


# ! STEP 1.7: set speed variable
speed = 1

# ! STEP 2.3: define functions for moving turtle
def turn_left():
    player.left(30) # move turtle by 30 degrees when left arrow is pressed

def turn_right():
    player.right(30) # move turtle by 30 degrees when right arrow is pressed

def increase_speed():
    global speed # moving out of local function into global environment
    speed += 1 # increase speed by 1 with every keystroke up

# ! STEP 2.8.a: decrease speed using down arrow
def decrease_speed():
    global speed # moving out of local function into global environment
    speed -= 1 # increase speed by 1 with every keystroke up

# ! STEP 5.1: convert collision checking into function

        return True
    else:
        return False

# ! STEP 2.2: set keyboard binding
turtle.listen() # listen for keystroke (onkey method)
turtle.onkey(turn_left, 'Left')
turtle.onkey(turn_right, 'Right')
turtle.onkey(increase_speed, 'Up')

# ! STEP 2.8.b: decrease speed using down arrow
turtle.onkey(decrease_speed, 'Down')

# ! STEP 1.8: move turtle
while True:
    player.forward(speed) # moves turtle at speed of 1

    # ! STEP 3.4: boundary detection & turtle bounce
    # boundary player checking x coordinate (bounce turtle off x/left and right edges)

    # ! STEP 6.4: make food move faster (From 1 to 3) --> REPLACED WITH STEP 7.3

        food.forward(3)

    # ! STEP 7.3: indent -->
        # ! STEP 6.6: change angle of food when it hits boundary (bounce food off edges)

# ! ----------- Replaced Code:

# # ! STEP 4.1: create food --> REPLACED WITH STEP 7.2
# food = turtle.Turtle()
# food.color('lightgreen')
# food.shape('circle') # cabbage for turtle to eat and gain points
# food.penup()
# food.speed(0) # immediately draw food on screen

# # ! STEP 4.3: set food position --> REPLACED WITH STEP 4.10
# # food.setposition(-100, 100) # set position of food (instead of same position as turtle) --> REPLACE with STEP 4.10

# # ! STEP 4.10: set food position to random position on screen --> REPLACED WITH STEP 7.2
# food.setposition(random.randint(-290, 290), random.randint(-290, 290)) # random position on screen (away from border and turtle)
    
    # # ! STEP 4.6: collision checking --> REMOVED and REPLACED WITH STEP 5.2
    # # calculate distance between turtle and food
    # # this formula is the distance formula between two points and uses pythagorean theorem
    # d = math.sqrt( 
    #         math.pow( # square root of sum of squares
    #             player.xcor() # x coordinate

    # if d < 20: # if distance is less than 20 pixels

    #     # food.hideturtle() # hide food when turtle eats it --> REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH STEP 4.8

    #     # ! STEP 4.8: move turtle after eating food  --> REMOVED and REPLACED WITH STEP 5.2
    #     food.setposition(random.randint(-290, 290), random.randint(-290, 290)) # move food to random position on screen (away from border and turtle)

    # # ! STEP 5.2: collision checking using new function from step 5.1 (replaced steps 4.6 + 4.8)
    #     # ! STEP 6.3: have food move fom a random position ---> MOVED. SEE STEP 7.4
